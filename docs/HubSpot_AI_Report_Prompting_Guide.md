# HubSpot AI Report Prompting Guide 🔮

This guide explains how to craft high-performance prompts for HubSpot's AI Report Builder (Breeze AI). To get the most accurate results, prompts should be structured as direct commands with specific technical context.

## 🏗️ The Anatomy of a Perfect Prompt

A "Red Carpet" prompt typically includes four critical pillars:

| Pillar | What to Include | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Object(s)** | Which CRM objects should the report analyze? | "Deals", "Contacts & Companies" |
| **2. The Metric** | What are you measuring? (Count, Sum, Avg) | "Sum of Amount", "Count of Records" |
| **3. The Dimension** | How should the data be sliced or grouped? | "Grouped by Deal Stage", "By Create Date" |
| **4. The Visual** | What chart type should be used? | "Bar Chart", "Line Graph", "Table" |

## 🛠️ Advanced Prompting Strategies

### 1. Use Internal Property Names
HubSpot's AI performs significantly better when you use internal property names (e.g., `hs_analytics_source`) rather than just labels (e.g., "Original Source"). 

*   **Good:** "Show me deals by source."
*   **Best:** "Create a bar chart of **deals** showing the **sum of amount** grouped by **hs_analytics_source**."

### 2. Define Precise Timeframes
Avoid vague terms like "recently." Use HubSpot-native timeframe logic.

*   **Relative:** "This quarter", "Last 90 days", "Year to date".
*   **Static:** "Between 2024-01-01 and 2024-03-31".

### 3. Specify Aggregation Logic
Be explicit about how the numbers should be calculated.

*   **Count:** "Number of records"
*   **Financial:** "Sum of amount", "Average ARR"
*   **Time-based:** "Average days to close"

## 📋 Prompt Template

Use this template to build your own prompts:

> "Create a **[Visualization Type]** of **[Object]** showing the **[Aggregation]** of **[Property]** grouped by **[Dimension Property]**, filtered by **[Date Property]** is **[Timeframe]**."

## 🪑 The "IKEA-Style" Blueprint
When building complex reports manually, follow the **IKEA Assembly Method**:

1.  **Step 1: The Foundation (Data Source)** - Choose your primary object.
2.  **Step 2: The Screws (Filters)** - Add your date ranges and status filters.
3.  **Step 3: The Structure (Configuration)** - Set your X and Y axes.
4.  **Step 4: The Finish (Visualization)** - Select the chart type that tells the best story.
